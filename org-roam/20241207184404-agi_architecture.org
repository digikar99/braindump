#+title: AGI Architecture

A phenomena P in the world gets registered as potentially high-dimensional stimulus, call this X_P.

X_P is processed by the architecture $f$ in the context of the system goals or organism state S_t to produce a new state S_{t+1} and potentially high-dimensinal pre-action activations Y_A. Thus,

#+begin_center
$Y_A, S_{t+1} = f(X_P, S_t)$
#+end_center

Y_A is acted upon by the actuators to produce an action A. An action may be a usual motor action (say, move a finger) or even an intellectual action (say, write the letter 'O').

Framed this way, the AGI architecture is identical to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network][Recurrent Neural Network]]. The research questions that this framework creates pertain to the good characterizations of:

1. Input registration X_P
2. Architecture $f and hidden state S
3. Pre-Action activations Y_A
