#+title: Non-identifiability of Behavioral Definitions

A particular behavior (Leg hitting the ball) has a unique physical or neural cause in its immediate temporal neighborhood. However, [[id:fbec938b-0bee-4027-a45a-a70a9e3cbdf4][Folk Psychology]] allows for the same behavior to be interpreted differently depending on the "background", for example

- The person playing football and making a pass
- The person's leg accidentally hitting it
- The person being angry and hitting the ball to break something / hit someone

TODO: What are the proper terms used in the psychology, philosophy or cognitive science literature for this phenomena?
