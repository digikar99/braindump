#+title: Development of Causal Learning

Reference: Goddu, M.K., Gopnik, A. The development of human causal learning and reasoning. /Nat Rev Psychol/ 3, 319â€“339 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s44159-024-00300-5

The review article argues that causal understanding in humans is depersonalized (objective) and decontextualized (general). However, this is not the case with most (all) animals [or with children?].

TODO:

1. The article provides pointers to articles indicating that causation might not be a natural kind. See references 18 and 22.

2. The link between causal understanding, empowerment and reinforcement learning is also interesting. See second last paragraph for reference 304.

* Structure of the paper

** Introduction

** Human-unique causal understanding

** Development of human causal understanding

** Causal learning in naturalistic contexts

** Development of related abilities

** Summary and Future directions

Animals usually have only a first person notion of interventions. Some can have a third person notion too. On the other hand, [adult] humans have an depersonalized/agent-independent/objective notion of intervention. COMMENT: It is this that actually enables us to build tools.
