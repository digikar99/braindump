#+title: Representations (CogSci)

Representations are a physical symbol/code used by an [cognitively advanced] organism in its mental operation or computation.

Intuitively, representations are the mental objects appearing in our thoughts and beliefs. However, they are expected to have a neural imprint in the brain. TODO: Issues with neurophysical markers of mental representations?

Representations may have referents but they need not. For example, the mental object 'a pot of gold' is a representation [in someone's mind - your or mine or another organism]. However, unless the pot of gold actually exists in reality, the representation does not actually have a referent!
