#+title: Hidden State of AGI Architecture

The [[id:4fcccb03-20b4-4764-9844-801303504c93][AGI Architecture]] is given by $Y_A, S_{t+1} = f(X_P, S_t)$.

For reasons of memory efficiency, it'd make sense to minimize the state S as far as possible.

For a self-sufficient system, S must include:

1. Battery status / Power availability
2.
