Given [[id:81e63f8b-35d8-4714-b3fa-3d44447c0c1b][Levels in Perspective Taking]], the question arises: what do the different levels mean for how the mind is organized?

1. Initially, what we see is our world.
2. That there are other agents is builtin.
3. That other agents have a field of vision is also builtin.
4. Eventually, because other agents often seem to look at something that is not our world, one may be said to experience a [[id:1360c08b-746b-4f55-abce-96958ef0798b][Cognitive Conflict]] and may conclude that our world is incomplete. In other words, the world exceeds our immediate field of vision, and includes our past visual experience. This is the result of [[id:c6626052-dae2-4d2d-94a0-0b8564ff8873][Sharing Attention aka Level 0 Perspective Taking]].
