#+title: Benefit of Pretense

Leslie, A. M. (1987). Pretense and representation: The origins of "theory of mind." Psychological Review, 94(4), 412â€“426. https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.94.4.412

The rough idea is that Pretense is an intermediate step in the development of Theory of Mind. Pretense allows decoupling from reality, which also seems necessary for Theory of Mind.
