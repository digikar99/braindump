#+title: The Undecidability of Veridicality

It seems to me that [[id:d6eea95c-cc3c-44ef-8725-3fc69f7b2850][veridicality]] involves an assessment of a representation with respect to the reality. However, true reality cannot be know. What we only have is the version of reality that is in our heads.

It seems arbitrary and unfounded to assume that a representation can be veridical with respect to something in the scientist's head.

TODO: Do I understand veridicality correctly?
