#+title: Antonym concepts vs logical NOT

Naively, one may think that not(big) = small. However, 

1. We can entertain contradicting thoughts; thus, we cannot be relying on boolean logic. Whatever logic humans rely on must support entertaining contradictions. See [[id:063a9025-d908-4684-8631-f320cb2841d6][Problems with Logical Structure in LOT]].
2. See work by Uli Sauerland; particularly, children across (almost) all languages use double negation "mit ohne" during a phase of language acquisition; as if "negation" and "antonyms" are understood differently.
