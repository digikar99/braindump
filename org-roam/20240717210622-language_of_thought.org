#+title: Language of Thought

The claim is that mental operations are akin to the computations made over a formal language called /mentalese/. Amongst the different characteristics of mentalese, perhaps the central one is [[id:dc35ac51-aa39-417b-a67a-181113b14b2a][compositionality]].

Other characteristics include: [[id:a9057485-6909-439b-ae24-43d001ff926d][logical structure]] and [[id:b131514e-c81f-43d5-abd0-f5f898558c47][intentionality]].
