#+title: Using Causality

Causal information allows us to perform interventions. This means we can act on the environment in order to change it to meet particular goals.

1. In machine learning, by [[id:20428c0a-b49d-4569-83f4-14ad771a798a][Formalizing Causality]].
2. In statistical analyses by human researchers by [[id:04cb17de-26a7-4c50-8bc3-4eda368a4319][Systematizing Causality]].

TODO: Causality also seems to involve a notion of agency. However, the exact relation between causality and agency remains unexplored by me.
