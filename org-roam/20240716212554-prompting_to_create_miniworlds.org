#+title: Prompting to Create Miniworlds 

Perhaps a key to achieve AGI might be based on how intuitively humans can create worlds from words. A child does this through [[id:20997eac-fa20-4f85-a24f-cefe61da5b06][Wonder]] - by seeking explanations from others, validating those explanations through experimentation aka play.

The idea then is to use textual prompts to create [[id:4fbaec1f-4d09-4c1a-9621-ceeab7a00837][Causal Models]] - and then using these causal models to answer questions, as well as generating images and videos.

FIXME: Is that really the relevant context for the term 'Wonder' used in the book?
