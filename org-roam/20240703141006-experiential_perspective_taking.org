#+title: Experiential Perspective Taking

12 and 18 month old human infants keep track of what the other person is experiencing. As a result, they can also determine what is novel to the other person. See [[citet:&Moll2011Perspective]] for additional paradigms.

TODO: An unanswered question might be: Do infants keep track of the experiences of almost every person they witness experiencing?
