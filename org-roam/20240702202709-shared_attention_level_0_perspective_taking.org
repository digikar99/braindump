#+title: Shared Attention: Level 0 Perspective Taking

Around 9-12 months of age,

1. Human infants begin to attend to what the other person is attending to
2. Direct another person's attention by pointing to or showing the person excitedly about an object of their interest

[[id:88b82cb6-40fb-4e1e-a609-80e208982baf][Gaze Following]] is a prime example of the first and [[id:db27dd53-26fe-4fc4-b1da-99450e7de13f][Non-Imperative Pointing]] behaviors of the second. However, sharing or directing attention go beyond Gaze Following and Non-Imperative Pointing behaviors.
