#+title: Pretense is Deliberate

Pretense or Pretend Play differs from errors. An error might cause one to misperceive a rope as a snake, or an inedible toy as food. However, in pretend-play, the pretender /knows/ that the toy is actually not food, yet they may deliberately attribute the properties of food to the toy.
