#+title: Causality, 20th June 2024

The notion of causality may be summarized by "A is a cause of B, or B is an effect of A". This allows us to /intervene/ in order to bring about or prevent B by manipulating A. See [[id:04cb17de-26a7-4c50-8bc3-4eda368a4319][Systematizing Causality]].

Questions:

- Is that the only notion of causality?

Future Work:

- Hume and Causality
