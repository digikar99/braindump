#+title: Nonconceptual Representation

Usually, a [[id:c452d96a-3a9b-4803-9913-4b0d48c8a5bf][representation]] corresponds to a concept or category and thus necessarily involves an interpretation. However, this raises [[id:dc264d75-bffa-44a0-b6c4-c9d10cb02086][certain issues]].

On the other hand, /Nonconceptual representations/ avoid interpretation and allow the organism to access its environment without already conceptualizing or categorizing into preexisting concepts.

TODO: Are nonconceptual representations of Fodor same as registrations of Pylyshyn?
