#+title: Teleological Understanding and Rationality [TODO]

[[cite:&Csibra2013Teleological]]: They assume that there can actually exist a rational behavior with respect to a goal.

TODO: Check whether they actually make more general claims.

I'm willing to support that our perceptual-cognitive system comes up with built-in ways to detect shortest paths in visual representations but not necessarily more abstract domains.
